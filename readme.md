1. Account /Cart /Payment
Account page I’m creating a login page or Register page with some functionality like without name, email, password you unable to create an account and also for the confirmation of email & password I am adding extra input if both inputs are right then your account is creating Successfully. And store from the local store.

2. Login
For login, you have to write the same email or password used at the time of registration eg. for the registration used email is rocky@gmail.com & password is: 2786 Otherwise, come some alert username does not exist.

3. Cart
Card page I’m added functionality like removing items and increasing the number of items. And one more condition like your amount is 130 or above then you are qualified to select one free item.

4. Payment
Payment page to getting cart details and also I’m adding time of 4 minutes then after then the payment session expires and you have to refresh and again filled the details. after your cart details are filled then your page redirects from the delivery page and you get some randomly tracking number of 10 digits.

I worked on brands, anniversary edit & Sale page. I face lot of issues in javascript part but it gets resolved with discussing our friends.
I gave my best and did a lot of things but still, there are few functionally things that are left behind and remain static. I learnt some new things in local storage in javascript, how to append and add to product to the cart, making sliding, and drop down pages.
